                            ========================

                      by SnowBro <kentmhan@online.no>

    This is a clone of Nintendo's Game & Watch "BombSweeper" from 1987.
    It's a simple, addictive puzzler. You are John Solver, fearless bomb
    squad person, who has to save the city from Jack, a demented criminal
    who is trying to blow it all up with his bombs.

    Overview of features
    --------------------
    - Mimics graphics/gameplay/sound from original BombSweeper game, with
      a few enhancements
    - 26 of the original levels included, 73 new ones, for a total of
      99 levels
    - Make your own levels with the built-in, easy-to-use level editor!
      Up to 99 different levels can be stored simultaneously
    - Demo mode, where I walk through 12 of the levels :)
    - Hidden key combo enables level selection cheat (who will be the first
      to find it?)

    Gameplay
    --------
    Each level is a maze, where you have to move around walls (using the
    D-pad) in order to find a path to the bomb. You can only move a wall
    when it's not blocked by a neighbour wall. If you don't make it in
    time, or you make the wrong moves, the bomb will explode and you lose
    a life. The faster you reach the bomb, the more points you get.

    When you reach 50,000 points, you are awarded an extra life.

    If, at any time, you realize you've put yourself in a jam and are
    unable to complete a level, you can hold down SELECT, then press START
    to make the bomb explode on purpose (so you don't have to wait for the
    timer to hit zero). You'll still lose a life, of course.

    Using the level editor
    ----------------------
    Use the D-pad to move.
    The A button toggles the horizontal wall at the current position.
    The B button toggles the vertical wall at the current position.
    Toggling a wall at the level border will cause a bomb to be placed there.
    Max. 8 bombs per level.
    Push START to save the level, including John Solver's starting position.
    If you're using an emulator, you can make a savestate or RAM dump to
    save your levels permanently (they will be erased from CPU memory
    when the game is reset/unloaded).
    When test playing the level, hold SELECT, then press START to exit to
    the design menu.

    Want to help?
    -------------
    If you have the BombSweeper instruction manual, I'd appreciate it if
    you could scan it/type it in and send it to me.

    Levels requested!
    -----------------
    Think you've made some good levels? Then make a savestate or RAM dump
    and send it my way. Your levels might get included in the next version!

    Future plans
    ------------
    - Add more differences between Game A and Game B (maybe a
      whole new set of levels, if I receive enough of them from you)
    - Add bonus game between every 10th level, like in the original game
    - Make the difficulty more balanced (right now the difficulty from
      level to level is a bit random)
    - Maybe expand the gameplay to include powerups of various sorts
      (I have a few ideas, but you're welcome to make suggestions as well)
